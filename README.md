# Road-Accident-Exploratory-Analysis
As a Data Scientist with 10Alytics, I developed an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard aimed at identifying key patterns and insights in UK road accident data. The dashboard integrates descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis to provide a comprehensive view of accident trends.

## Key highlights include:

### 🧠 Overconfidence in Urban Areas

Urban zones, with better road infrastructure, actually saw more accidents—not because of poor conditions, but due to driver overconfidence, leading to speeding and reduced vigilance.

### 🌄 Rural Areas = More Fatalities

Fewer accidents, but deadlier outcomes. Factors like delayed emergency response, fewer bystanders, and limited medical facilities likely contribute to this trend.

### ⏰ Time of Day Tells a Story

Accidents spiked in the early morning and evening, aligning with rush hours, fatigue, distraction, and visibility issues—highlighting the human element behind many crashes.

### 🌧️ Surprising Discovery: Weather & Road Surface Had Little Impact

During the project presentation, decision-makers were shocked to learn that climate and road conditions didn’t significantly contribute to accident frequency.
This finding flipped common assumptions on their head and emphasized the importance of behavioral awareness over environmental factors.

### 🛠 Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Seaborn), SQL, Excel and Tableau for analysis and storytelling dashboards.

### 🎯 Why This Matters:

This wasn’t just about identifying risk—it was about understanding human behavior, challenging expectations, and driving smarter interventions for public safety.

### 🚀 What I Bring to the Table:

✅ Turning raw data into strategic decisions
✅ Communicating complex insights clearly
✅ Challenging assumptions with evidence

### 👋 Open to roles where data meets decision-making—and where analytics can directly impact real lives. Let’s connect! and get things done.
